## Project 1
Aim: Created a model, FEature STructure (FEST) to address the inaccuracy of RNA-seq expression problem.
Methods: EM algorithm, parameter estimation, Robustness and sensetivity analysis.

Code: waiting for uploading from old MATLAB repository

## Project 1
Aim: Created a model, GAIS (Gene Activity Impacted Score) to predict tumor features from the measurements of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or Whole Exome Sequencing (WES).
Methods: Factor Graph (latent variable model) for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), structure variation (SV), insert or deletion (INDEL), and copy number variation (CNV). EM algorithm, penalized complete-data log-likelihood function.
